### Refine Your Points
- Implemented CI workflows using GitHub Actions to automate build and test execution.
- Integrated automated test suites into pipelines to ensure build reliability.
- Configured pipelines to fail when tests did not meet quality thresholds.
- Containerized applications using Docker for consistent deployment environments.


“I started with strong manual testing at Capgemini. At Stratus, testing became part of the release cycle, where I worked closely with builds and environment validation. At Opennets, I moved fully into CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions.”
